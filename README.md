# terraform-blueprints
🚀 Terraform projects and labs — practical implementations of IaC concepts using modules, functions, dynamic blocks, and map-based iterations.

# Terraform Labs 🧩

This repository contains a collection of **Terraform-based Infrastructure as Code (IaC) projects** — covering a wide range of use cases from foundational setups to advanced infrastructure design patterns.
It serves as a **central workspace for Terraform experiments, reusable modules, and environment automation**.
